# Living-expense-management
This is the repository for the project for the living expense program.

I built this program to help Korean international students to manage their budgets more effienctly. The users can choose the currency between USD($) and WON(â‚©).
My program shows the average daily expenses, weekly expenses, the most spent week, and the most spent cateory.

There are 6 catogories to classify the expenses: Groceries, delivery foods, apartment fees, fees for studying, and others.

Using PyTorch, my programs shows the weekly expenses and the expended categories through the bar graphs. The users can easily know when they spent their budget most and to where they spent their budgets.
